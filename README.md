# LBPH SYSTEM
LBPH SYSTEM
This project is aimed at solving recurrent cases of child abduction at maternity facilities.
All it uses is LBPH face recognizer, a webcam (or IP Webcam), images of mothers and their respective babies.
The mother's image is matched to that of her baby
Once a stranger enters the maternity to steal the baby, an alarm is sounded since their image does not match that of the existing database.
The webcam also captures the stranger's photo and stores it in a database for future security reference.
That is how simple but efficient this project works!
